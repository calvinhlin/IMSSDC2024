In high power applications, silicon carbide (SiC) devices are reliable with high breakdown voltages but suffer from challenging gate drives at high frequency. This paper presents a resonant gate driver that can effectively reduce the gate loss at high frequency with broad bandwidth.

Historically, these types of PAs, operating in the tens-of-megahertz range in the industrial, scientific, and medical bands, were equipped for transmitters for fixed radiocommunication services, RF heating, and plasma ignition [1], [2]. Today, applications have expanded to wireless power transmission for biomedical devices and charging for consumer electronics and smart vehicles [3].

But high frequency loss mechanisms such as dynamic Rds,on and Coss loss can be significant and reduce their performance below what radio frequency (RF) silicon devices can achieve. We design and implement two 50 MHz class Φ2 converters to empirically compare the performance of GaN and Si devices at VHF. The experimental results show that the Si-based design with a resonant gate driver can achieve higher efficiency and better thermal performance compared to the GaN-based design with conventional gating circuitry.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The “cubesat” form factor has been adopted as the defacto standard for a cost effective and modular, nano-satellite platform. Many commercial options exist for nearly all components required to build such satellite; however, there is a limited range of thruster options that suit the power and size restrictions of a cubesat. Based on the prior work on the “Pocket Rocket” electro-thermal capacitively-coupled radiofrequency (RF) plasma thruster operating at 13.56 MHz, a new design is proposed which is based on an inductively-coupled radiofrequency plasma system operating at 40.68 MHz. The new thruster design, including a compact and efficient radiofrequency matching network adjacent to the plasma cavity, is presented, together with the first direct thrust measurements using argon as the propellant with the thruster immersed in vacuum and attached to a calibrated thrust balance. These initial results of the unoptimized first proof of concept indicate an up to 40\% instantaneous thrust gain from the plasma compared to the cold gas thrust: typical total thrust at 100 SCCM of argon and 50 W RF power is {\textasciitilde}1.1 mN.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Unfortunately, due to high-frequency losses in wide-bandgap semiconductors and low-Q high-frequency coil designs, these systems are universally less efficient, on a dc–dc basis, than wireless power systems operating at conventional frequency regimes. This letter describes the design considerations for inductive wireless power transfer systems operating at 6.78 MHz. With a novel high-frequency resonant amplifier topology, a high-Q self-resonant coil structure, and a better understanding of C$_{\textrm{oss}}$ losses in wide-bandgap power semiconductors, we demonstrate 6.78- MHz wireless power transfer systems that achieve 95\% dc–dc efficiency at power levels up to and beyond 1 kW.},

	abstract = {The origin of Coss and the energy dissipation due to output capacitance can be roughly separated into two types: resistive loss and capacitive hysteresis loss. The resistive losses are due to the resistance of GaN buffer layers and Si-substrate. These loss components can be potentially improved by re-engineering the doping concentrations in the buffer stacks and substrate layer [1] [2]. However, the capacitive hysteresis loss that is suspected to be due to trapping dynamics remains largely unexplained. This paper presents a physics view of the trapping dynamics that is related to Coss in the GaN HEMT under large-signal excitations. It is observed that under large-signal excitation, deeper traps in the buffer layers only account for a remnant portion of observed dynamic Coss losses. Instead, traps with shallow energy levels (in the range of 0.5eV above valence band) are mostly responsible for the charge imbalance and energy dissipation. By identifying dominant types of traps and relevant trap energy levels in GaN HEMT, we can gain important insights on how to optimize the device stack design for high-frequency applications.},

	abstract = {Gallium nitride high-electron-mobility transistors (GaN-HEMTs) suffer from trapping effects that increases device on-state resistance (RDS(on)) above its theoretical value. This increase is a function of the applied dc bias when the device is in its off state, and the time which the device is biased for. Thus, dynamic RDS(on) of different commercial GaN-HEMTs are characterised at different bias voltages in the paper by a proposed new measurement circuit. The time-constants associated with trapping and detrapping effects in the device are extracted using the proposed circuit and it is shown that variations in RDS(on) can be predicted using a series of RC circuit networks. A new methodology for integrating these RDS(on) predictions into existing gallium nitride-high-electron-mobility transistors models in standard SPICE simulators to improve model accuracy is then presented. Finally, device dynamic RDS(on) values of the model is compared and validated with the measurement when it switches in a power converter with different duty cycles and switching voltages.},
