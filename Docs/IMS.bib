	abstract = {Gallium nitride high-electron-mobility transistors (GaN-HEMTs) suffer from trapping effects that increases device on-state resistance (RDS(on)) above its theoretical value. This increase is a function of the applied dc bias when the device is in its off state, and the time which the device is biased for. Thus, dynamic RDS(on) of different commercial GaN-HEMTs are characterised at different bias voltages in the paper by a proposed new measurement circuit. The time-constants associated with trapping and detrapping effects in the device are extracted using the proposed circuit and it is shown that variations in RDS(on) can be predicted using a series of RC circuit networks. A new methodology for integrating these RDS(on) predictions into existing gallium nitride-high-electron-mobility transistors models in standard SPICE simulators to improve model accuracy is then presented. Finally, device dynamic RDS(on) values of the model is compared and validated with the measurement when it switches in a power converter with different duty cycles and switching voltages.},

	abstract = {The origin of Coss and the energy dissipation due to output capacitance can be roughly separated into two types: resistive loss and capacitive hysteresis loss. The resistive losses are due to the resistance of GaN buffer layers and Si-substrate. These loss components can be potentially improved by re-engineering the doping concentrations in the buffer stacks and substrate layer [1] [2]. However, the capacitive hysteresis loss that is suspected to be due to trapping dynamics remains largely unexplained. This paper presents a physics view of the trapping dynamics that is related to Coss in the GaN HEMT under large-signal excitations. It is observed that under large-signal excitation, deeper traps in the buffer layers only account for a remnant portion of observed dynamic Coss losses. Instead, traps with shallow energy levels (in the range of 0.5eV above valence band) are mostly responsible for the charge imbalance and energy dissipation. By identifying dominant types of traps and relevant trap energy levels in GaN HEMT, we can gain important insights on how to optimize the device stack design for high-frequency applications.},

This letter describes the design considerations for inductive wireless power transfer systems operating at 6.78 MHz.

Many commercial options exist for nearly all components required to build such satellite; however, there is a limited range of thruster options that suit the power and size restrictions of a cubesat. Based on the prior work on the “Pocket Rocket” electro-thermal capacitively-coupled radiofrequency (RF) plasma thruster operating at 13.56 MHz, a new design is proposed which is based on an inductively-coupled radiofrequency plasma system operating at 40.68 MHz. The new thruster design, including a compact and efficient radiofrequency matching network adjacent to the plasma cavity, is presented, together with the first direct thrust measurements using argon as the propellant with the thruster immersed in vacuum and attached to a calibrated thrust balance. These initial results of the unoptimized first proof of concept indicate an up to 40\% instantaneous thrust gain from the plasma compared to the cold gas thrust: typical total thrust at 100 SCCM of argon and 50 W RF power is {\textasciitilde}1.1 mN.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

A design method is derived by performing an analysis of the circuit assuming load current is sinusoidal. Because the switch current is smaller than that of conventional class E amplifiers (with the same output power), the losses due to the series saturation resistance of the switch device are greatly reduced for the proposed amplifier.

Generally, the output network must present the drain with either an open or short circuit at the harmonic frequencies. At VHF and higher frequencies, the drain capacitance, lead inductance, lead length, and dispersion make implementation of reasonably ideal tuned circuits difficult. However it is possible to control the impedances at a finite number of harmonics. This note first derives the basic relationships among the Fourier coefficients of the waveforms and the performance of the amplifier. Fourier coefficients for maximally flat waveforms are then derived for inclusion of up to the fifth harmonic. Amplifier performance is then tabulated as a function of which harmonics are included in the voltage and current waveforms. Efficiency increases from 50\% of class A toward 100\% as harmonics are added. Power-output capability increases by up to 27\%.},
